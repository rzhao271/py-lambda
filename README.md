# py-lambda

This repository contains somewhat cursed Python scripts and experiments that are mostly focused on lambda functions. 

`z.py`, whose contents show up in a lot of the other files, is based on the [strict fixed-point combinator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_combinator#Strict_fixed-point_combinator), which allows for recursion without having to use the `def` keyword.
